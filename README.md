# Quantum Computing

Welcome to the **Quantum Computing** repository!  
This project explores the fundamentals and applications of quantum computing, providing code samples, explanations, and visualizations to help you understand this cutting-edge field.

## 🚀 Overview

Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical computers.  
Key concepts include **qubits**, **superposition**, **entanglement**, and **quantum gates**.

---

## 🧩 Features

- **Introductory guides** to quantum computing concepts
- **Code samples** for quantum algorithms (e.g., Grover's, Shor's)
- **Visual explanations** of quantum phenomena
- **Simulations** using Python and Qiskit

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive tutorials)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantumcomputing.git
cd quantumcomputing
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧠 Quantum Concepts

- **Qubit**: The basic unit of quantum information.
- **Superposition**: A qubit can be in a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be correlated in ways impossible for classical bits.
- **Quantum Gates**: Operations that change qubit states.

---

## 💻 Usage

Run example quantum circuits:

```bash
python examples/superposition.py
```

Or open Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## 🖼️ Visual Explanations

### Qubit State

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
```

**Bloch Sphere Representation:**

```
         |0⟩
          |
          |
          |
          •----|ψ⟩
         /
        /
      |1⟩
```

### Quantum Circuit Example

```
|0⟩ ---[H]---●---
              |
|0⟩ ---------[X]---
```
- `[H]`: Hadamard gate (creates superposition)
- `[X]`: Pauli-X gate (quantum NOT)
- `●`: Control for CNOT gate
